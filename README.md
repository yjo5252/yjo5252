### Hi there 👋  

1️⃣ 🧑‍🚀 Hello. My name is Yeeun Jo.

2️⃣ I love to travel, so I was looking for a way for college students to go abroad. I fell in love with software programs while developing a VR game project at the EPIT University summer exchange program in Paris, France in 2018! Since then, I have been working on a development project, and in 2021, I applied AR technology in an in-school media arts class to produce and display brand marketing works.

3️⃣ My research interests span Human-centered computing and Usable Privacy and Security.

4️⃣ I want to create a service that uses technology to design people's lives!
✨ Research and service development in Human-Computer Interaction and Human Factors.

5️⃣ My hobbies are tennis, photography, watching exhibitions/movies/documents, and visiting restaurants! I enjoy working in a collaborative environment. I wish you all the best!💜

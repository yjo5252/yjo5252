### Hi there üëã  

1Ô∏è‚É£ üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Hello. My name is Yeeun Jo, who studied a double major in Computer Engineering and Digital Humanities. My research area lies in the overlapping area of human-computer interaction, Aritifical intelligence, and Secruity and Privacy. I am in the joureny of finding more designated research statemnt.

2Ô∏è‚É£ I love to travel, so I was looking for a way for college students to go abroad.

3Ô∏è‚É£ My fields of interest include Human-centered AI, XR service, BCI brain science service, IT product experience, and media art!

4Ô∏è‚É£ I want to create a service that uses technology to design people's lives!<br>
‚ú® Long-term goal (10 years) Research and service development in the fields of Human Computer Interaction and Human Factors.<br>
‚ú® Short-term goal (6 months) XR development project, algorithm solving practice, and reading paper and research topics in HCI/AI/Haptic Interface. 

5Ô∏è‚É£ My hobbies are tennis, photography, watching exhibitions/movies/documents, and visiting restaurants! I enjoy working on collaborative environment. I wish you all the best!üíú
